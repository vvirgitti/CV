## Skills

#### Problem solving

My main task as an acquisition manager was to solve one big problem: how to maximize results (number of members or revenue) with less and less money. 
- While at Zulily, I tripled the number of new members while decreasing the cost per member by restructuring the various SEM and Facebook ads accounts.
- At vente-privee.com, I launched a series of multivariable tests on landing pages; multiple iterations enabled me to find the most efficient page that doubled the conversion rates in Germany and Spain, which in turn decreased the cost per member.

#### Communication

Online marketing relies heavily on good communication as it always involves working with various internal teams (IT, Creative, Customer Service...) but also external (agencies, third parties, partners...).
- At Zulily I worked closely with the Sales and Creative teams based in London, and also with the IT and Marketing teams based in the US. 
- I regularly presented results to senior management in the UK and the US.


#### Team work

Marketing and especially Acquisition marketing is part of an ensemble and can only work properly thanks to other departments. Team work is therefore critical to ensure maximum results.
- At vente-privee.com, I worked closely with Creative team to promote the use of testing; this enabled us to design the most effective display banners by using data.
- I am a commited member of a competitive sports team, and have played softball at a national club level for the last 10 years. You learn a lot about team spirit and support when you're under pressure!

#### Managing effective online marketing campaigns 
I have excellent experience in online marketing campaigns, working on various channels (Google Adwords, display and affiliate networks, Facebook ads, SEO etc.) for high profile online companies.
- I have experience in multi-channel strategies (Google Adwords, Facebook ads, display and affiliates network...) for various countries.
- I recruited a record number of new members of 100k in a month while working for Cocosa, for which I earned the company's Outstanding Achievement Award.
